\section{Background}

\subsection{Previous Work on Mental Health of Soldiers}

In order to make medical diagnosis for patients, psychologists often use the linguistic content and expression of patients to judge their emotional changes and mental state according to previous research in psychology and linguistic. The clinical diagnosis efficiency has been greatly improved because of the progress of science and technology, especially in computational linguistics. In addition, the wide spread of social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, has provided mental researchers with a large scale of data. Therefore, they could easily use the collected dataset and machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis.

Linguistic contents which users posted on social media have been proved to be the basis for evaluating a person's mental state \citep{becauseIwastoldsomuch} \citep{GUNTUKU201743}. However, the majority of research targets are civilians. In this paper, veterans and civilians will be regarded as research targets. Westgate in \citep{doi:10.1176/appi.ps.201400283} has come up with a method about evaluation of Veterans’ Suicide Risk. However, this paper will concentrate on analyzing the impact of the war on veterans' mental state through comparing the tweets posted by soldiers with the twitters released by civilians. In addition, a comprehensive sentiment analysis of veterans will be summarized.

\subsection{Sentiment and Emotion Analysis on Social Media}

Sentiment analysis has been applied to various fields, such as the research about consumer behavior on product marketing and the analysis for political voting. The advances in Natural Language Processing and linguistic research have led to the development of different methods of sentiment analysis.

Nowadays, people tend to use social media such as Twitter to post tweets and express their opinions and emotions. Most of the tweets generated from Twitter accounts are public by default and easy to obtain online. Also, the tweets are short(limited to 280 characters) and often appears with spelling mistakes and slangs. A tweet often comes with other features like spreading tweets(retweet) from other accounts. These mentioned above make the tweets become a good channel to explore sentiment analysis.

Generally speaking, the common approaches for sentiment analysis consist two parts, including the machine learning techniques based and the lexicon based. Analyzing users’ social activities and calculating linguistic features of user-generated texts are the core for the machine learning algorithm. Compared with machine learning based method, the lexicon based method is more direct and straightforward. In sentiment analysis, the typical task is finding the polarities of the given texts. The tests are probably positive, negative or neutral. Lexicon based method could recognize and analyze the words about sentiment and other emoticons and hashtags which are associated with sentiment.

Therefore, the sentiment lexicons are adopted for matching the words from tweets, thus analyzing and determining the polarities of the corpus.

\cite{azizan2019lexicon} performed sentiment analysis on Twitter data about movie review tweets using R and lexicon-based method.They found that lexicon-based method is more effective than machine learning based method under the same calculation cost. \cite{8073512} used a dictionary based method and analyzed the results at aspect level and document level to predict public’s sentiment using tweets about product review.

SentiWordNet and SenticNet, as open lexicons resources, have been developed in recent years. Sentiwordnet is a lexical resource which scores a text on three premises object, positivity and negativity. It is an open-source software which is free to use and helps in extracting the sentiment of the text. Due to the high accuracy, the SentiWordNet 3.0 \citep{baccianella2010sentiwordnet} will be used as lexicons in this paper.

\cite{montejo2012random} has defined a work that uses SentiWordNet on Twitter data to identify the polarity of sentiment of the users. They extract weighted vector and use it in the SentiWordNet to determine the polarity making it an unsupervisedsolution. We will use SentiWordNet on tweets in order to find the differences between the tweets of a soldier and that of a normal user.
