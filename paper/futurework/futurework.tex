\section{Future Works}

Thought we did try to answer our research question by applying two different analysis, there is always scope of improvement. One area where we like to work further is to extract data depending upon the timestamp. We wanted to get extract data depending on times when the veterans returned from a war and then compare it with his own tweets that they did before the war, but this can be done in future. And definitely is an area to work forward.
