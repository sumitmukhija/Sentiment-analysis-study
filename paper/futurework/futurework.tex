\section{Future Works}

Thought we did try to answer our research question by applying two different analysis, there is always scope of improvement. One area where we like to work further is to extract data depending upon the timestamp. We wanted to get extract data depending on times when the veterans returned from a war and then compare it with their own tweets before the war. For the sentiment and emotion analysis, negators (e.g. not, isn't, won't) need to be considered for that they contribute strong and opposite effects towards polarity and word meaning. A cross comparison should be made as the work of \cite{emoIntenT} but on our corpora. These works can be done in future, and definitely worth exploring.
