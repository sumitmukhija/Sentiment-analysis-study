\begin{abstract}
  The concern to veterans' mental health should be made. Existing works show that mental health changes caused by wars can be reflected in lexical and non-lexical features of the social media texts. In order to detect and compare those changes we collected data from 208 soldiers' tweets (n=6,61,342) with 280 civilians' tweets (n=6,00,173). We examined them with lexical and non-lexical aspects. Elements and attributes of tweets are processed and included as non-lexical features. Sentiment and emotion analysis is made on the corpora. We did a close look to the results with discussion and identified the differences between civilians and soldiers in both possitive and negative directions. \\
