\section{Conclusion}

The results that we received after extracting and processing the data for the soldiers and the civilians conclude that there exists a sense of emotional dilemma to the veterans when compared to normal people. They do show characteristics of using a higher amount of curse words along with longer messages just to name a few. With the high amount of data that we had along with the preprocessing and methodologies used we are certain that we were able to prove our research area and come to a conclusion at the end of our research. Nevertheless, we feel that there is still a lot of work that exits in these areas and we hope that our findings enlighten other researchers to deep dive furthermore.
