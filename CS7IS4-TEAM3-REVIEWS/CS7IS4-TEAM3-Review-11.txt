Rating: 4

8)  Does the description of research methods indicate how the
    corpus will be processed in order to assess it according to
    the categorization scheme proposed within the essay?

Rating:4

Comments: Yes the essay explains how the corpus would be processed. The work classifies tweets into sad and happy. Is this data sufficient? Emotions such as anger, happiness etc. can be classified as positive or negative. But, does it necessarily imply 'depression'.

9)  Does the description of research methods indicate how the relevant
    quantities and qualities will be measured and assessed,
    stipulating what would count as a confirmation of the authors'
    hypotheses and what would count as falsification of the authors'
    hypotheses?

Rating: 3

Comments: The essay says that the tweets would be categorised into sad or happy, but doesn't explain the qualities and quantities that would be taken into consideration. It doesn't mention of the methods or tools used to analyse the sentiment in the extracted tokens.

10) Are the research methods appropriate to the question studied?

Rating:3

Comments: The question is not expicitly mentioned. Assuming the research to be on analysing sentiment in the tweets of veterans, the design or flow of the process. It would have been good if examples of data used are provided. Also, the tools used to analyse sentiment are not mentioned.


11) Does the underlying research result in the assembly of a data set
    that will be useful to the wider research community?

Rating: 2

Comments: The data set wouldn't be useful to the wider research community. Since it is a small data set of tweets from 20 veterans. Also, it is mentioned that 6 veterans were selected. And it is later mentioned that 20 Veterans were selected. Why was the number 6 previously mentioned and is there a reason? This has brought in some confusion.

Rating: 0

Comments: No results provided

    with reference to the research questions posed?

Rating: 3

18) Does the description of individual contributions suggest an
    equitable division of labour?

Rating: 4

Comments: Yes the description of individual contributions suggest an equitable division of labour. But, the time spent cannot be usually assessed. The number of references were less, which could indicate lesser exploration and reading.


19) Does the description of individual contributions provide
    sufficiently rich description of the individual contributions in
    a manner that allows an independent reader to assess who
    contributed what and in a fashion that justifies any percentage
    estimates of work?

Rating:3

Comments: The description of the work doesn't allow an independent reader to assess who contributed what and in a fashion that justifies any percentage
estimates of work. E.g., the work of extracting data from Twitter involved contributions from all the members of the group except one.

20) What qualities of this paper would you argue that your own
    group should try to emulate?

    group should try to avoid?
